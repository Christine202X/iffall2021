        <p>1. Christine Bi, Communication design, junior.</p>
        <p>2. I am taking this class as a requirement, but I am pretty interested in interaction design.</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience with these.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn the basics of coding and designing a web page.</p>
        <P>5. I think designing for screen requires the learning of certain structures to build an interactive platform that communicates effectively to users.</P>
        <p>6. <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>, it is clean and simple and navigates well. I also like the sans serif typeface they use.</p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.farfetch.com">Farfetch</a>, because it divides the sections well, and makes it easer for users to find what they want.</p>
        <p>8. <a href="https://www.fontsinuse.com">Fonts In Use</a>, it works well for finding out what designers and artists are doing with a particular font and could be used as inspiration.</p>
